  abstract = {In recognition memory, a classic finding is that receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) are curvilinear. This has been taken to support the fundamental assumptions of signal detection theory (SDT) over discrete-state models such as the double high-threshold model (2HTM), which predicts linear ROCs. Recently, however, Br\"oder and Sch\"utz (2009) challenged this argument by noting that most of the data on which support for SDT is based have involved confidence ratings. The authors argued that certain types of rating scale usage may result in curved ROCs even if the generating process is thresholded in nature. From this point of view, only ROCs constructed via experimental bias manipulations are useful for discriminating between the models. Br\"oder and Sch\"utz conducted a meta-analysis and new experiments that compared SDT and the 2HTM using binary (yes--no) ROCs and found that many of these functions were linear, supporting 2HTM over SDT. We examine all the data reported by Br\"oder and Sch\"utz, noting important limitations in their methodology, analyses, and conclusions. We report a new meta-analysis and 2 new experiments to examine the issue more closely while avoiding the limitations of Br\"oder and Sch\"utz's study. These new data indicate that binary ROCs are curved in recognition, consistent with previous findings in perception and reasoning. Our results support classic arguments in favor of SDT and indicate that curvature in ratings ROCs is not task specific. We recommend the ratings procedure and suggest that analyses based on threshold models be treated with caution. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)}

This follows from a novel interpretation of forced-choice probabilities as the moments of a random variable whose distribution function determines the yes-no ROC; the first moment is just the area subtended by the ROC. We further develop the standard theory of the forced-choice paradigm, and obtain conditions allowing that theory to be verified in empirical data.}

A review of these recent approaches for the measurement of criterion noise in SDT identifies several shortcomings and confoundings. A reanalysis of Benjamin et al.'s (2009) data sets as well as the results from a new experimental method indicate that the different forms of criterion noise proposed in the recognition memory literature are of very low magnitudes, and they do not provide a significant improvement over the account already given by traditional SDT without criterion noise.

These 2 accounts are usually evaluated by comparing their (penalized) fits to receiver operating characteristic data, a procedure that is predicated on substantial auxiliary assumptions, which if violated can invalidate results. We show that the 2 accounts can be compared on the basis of critical tests that invoke only minimal assumptions. Using previously published receiver operating characteristic data, we show that confidence-rating judgments are consistent with a discrete-state account.

The present work examines five main properties that are characteristic of existing SDT models of recognition memory: (a) random-scale representation, (b) latent-variable independence, (c) likelihood-ratio monotonicity, (d) ROC function asymmetry, and (e) nonthreshold representation. In each case, we establish testable consequences and test them against data collected in the appropriately designed recognition-memory experiment. We also discuss the connection between yes--no, forced-choice, and ranking judgments. This connection introduces additional behavioral constraints and yields an alternative method of reconstructing yes--no ROC functions. Overall, the reported results provide a strong empirical foundation for SDT modeling in recognition memory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

Yet its conventional application hinges almost exclusively on the Gaussian assumption---an adherence rooted more in historical convenience than theoretical necessity that comes with a number of well-documented drawbacks. In this work, we critically examine these limitations and introduce a principled parametric alternative: the Gumbel\_min model, based on extreme-value distributions of event minima. A key feature of this model is its grounding in a behavioral principle of invariance under uniform choice-set expansions---a prediction we empirically validate in a novel recognition-memory experiment. We further benchmark the Gumbel\_min model against its Gaussian counterpart across multiple recognition-memory tasks, including confidence-rating, ranking, forced-choice, and detection-plus-identification paradigms. Our findings highlight the model's parsimonious yet successful characterization of recognition-memory judgments, as well as the utility of its associated discriminability index, g', which can be directly computed from a single pair of hit and false-alarm rates.},

They found 25\% more variability in ratings for studied than for new items, which they interpreted as providing evidence that latent mnemonic strength distributions are 25\% more variable for studied than for new items. We show here that this conclusion is critically dependent on assumptions---so much so that these assumptions determine the conclusions. In fact, opposite conclusions, such that study does not affect the variability of latent strength, may be reached by making different but equally plausible assumptions. Because all measurements of mnemonic strength variability are critically dependent on untestable assumptions, all are arbitrary. Hence, there is no principled method for assessing the relative variability of latent mnemonic strength distributions.},

To address this, we investigate the viability of a shift representable signal detection model in which the shape of the familiarity distribution is the same for all old and new items. We present a new technique for fitting such models to recognition memory data using only ordinal properties of these data based on the monotonic linear regression algorithm described by Dunn and Anderson (Psychological Methods, 2024). We apply this methodology to analyse the results of three recognition memory experiments that vary the number of study presentations, studytest modality, focused vs. divided attention, and instructions to read study items or to generate them from cues. In each case, the data are well-described by a shift representable model with a recovered distributional form that has a negative skew that approximates the minimum extreme value, or Gumbel, distribution. We propose that if these results can be generalised across different experiments, it becomes possible to define a standard unit of measurement of familiarity that will enable direct comparisons to be made across different experiments and conditions. We discuss the implications of these results for current models of memory and for future application of our approach to other domains.},

However, the conceptual hurdles that had to be overcome before the theory could finally emerge in its modern form in the early 1950s seem to have been largely forgotten. Here, I trace the origins of signal detection theory, beginning with Fechner's (1860/1966) Elements of Psychophysics. Over and above the Gaussian-based mathematical framework conceived by Fechner in 1860, nearly a century would pass before psychophysicists finally realized in 1953 that the distribution of sensations generated by neural noise falls above, not below, the threshold of conscious awareness. An extensive body of single-unit recording and neuroimaging research conducted since then supports the idea that sensory noise yields genuinely felt conscious sensations even in the complete absence of stimulation. That hard-to-come-by insight in 1953 led immediately to the notion of a movable decision criterion and to the methodology of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Over the ensuing years, signal detection theory and ROC analysis have had an enormous impact on basic and applied science alike. Yet, in some quarters of our field, that fact appears to be virtually unknown. By tracing both its fascinating origins and its phenomenal impact, I hope to illustrate why no area of experimental psychology should ever be oblivious to signal detection theory.
